## **Repository for "2020-2021 School Neighborhood Poverty Estimates"**
My repository for LIS 545 includes publicly available files retrieved from data.gov for the dataset [_2020-2021 School Neighborhood Poverty Estimates_.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-neighborhood-poverty-estimates-current-c7e05) These estimates are based on school locations from the [Common Core of Data (CCD)](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp) school file as well as on income data from families with children 5-18 in the US Census Bureau's 2017-2021 [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html). This dataset uses IPR (income-to-poverty ratio) values calculated by the Census Bureau to establish its poverty estimates. The publisher for this dataset is the [National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/). 

### **Files I have included from the landing page of the dataset on data.gov:** 
* a CSV file
* a GeoJSON file 
* a KML file
* unzipped Shapefile folder which includes the original XML file

This dataset also includes data visualizations in the form of ArcGIS maps, which can be accessed in two different locations (and which are linked to from the landing page on data.gov); there is the [ArcGIS Hub Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-neighborhood-poverty-estimates-current-c7e05/resource/efcac15b-a9da-4671-a3a2-1c350fc8559c) hosted by Edge Open Data / NCES Open Data, and there is a link to the [ArcGIS GeoService](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-neighborhood-poverty-estimates-current-c7e05/resource/97d247b5-6736-417d-aa96-c0c2b944660e) landing page which connects to the same ArcGIS Hub Dataset (but one which is hosted directly on the ArcGIS website, not via Edge Open Data). 

### **Other files included in this repository:**
* Draft of my final report in .docx and .pdf 
* XML metadata file structured according to the DataCite metadata schema
